## Introduction
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
here are some questions I will try to find an answer for at the exploration part:
#### How did the number of movies change over year?
#### How did the runtime of movie affect the popularity?
#### what is the maximum and minimum runtime movie?
#### what is the maximum and minimum profit of movie?
#### How did profit change over years?
#### Is there a relationship between budget of  movie and its revenue over years?
#### Is there a relationship between the popularity of movie and its profit in average over years?
#### Is there a relationship between the popularity of  movie and its runtime in average over years?

## Investigate-a-dataset-tmdb-movies
> Using tmdb-movies to investigate the dataset using NumPy and Pandas.
> Investigating the tmbd_movies dataset, various plot and histograms for data and stastical analysis of dataset.

## Install

This project requires python and other python libraries installed.

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas

In this project, I will go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.

## Project Steps:
> Step One - choose Data Set:
- I choose tmdb-movies dataset from  
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTlVmknRRnfy_4eTrjw5hYGaiQim5ctr9naaRd4V9du2B5bxpd8FEH3KtDgp8qVekw7Cj1GLk1IXdZi/pub?embedded=True">this link</a>

> Step Two: Data Wrangling:
- load in the data.
- check for cleanliness.
- trim and clean my dataset for analysis.

> Step Three: Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Compute statistics and create visualizations with the goal of addressing the research questions that I posed in the Introduction section.

> Step Four:  Share Your Findings:
- create a report that shares the findings I found most interesting.

### What I learnt after completing the project:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
